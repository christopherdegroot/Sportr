## Sportr
Sportr is an app designed to be a 'Tinder style app', but for sports. Sportr allows users to create sport events that are shared to the larger community to be swiped on to find others to play a variety of pick-up style sports with. Building Sportr in less than two weeks was a great example of a real-world environment working with a team harmoniously while also teaching ourselves new tech stacks not covered in our bootcamp and meeting our set deadline.

## Final Product

Full demo of all component functions: logging in, browsing event feed and my events, creating events, viewing profiles, updating profiles (selecting events changes event feed contents based on events and preferences).
