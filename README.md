This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Sportr
Sportr is an app designed to be a 'Tinder style app', but for sports. Sportr allows users to create sport events that are shared to the larger community to be swiped on to find others to play a variety of pick-up style sports with. Building Sportr in less than two weeks was a great example of a real-world environment working with a team harmoniously while also teaching ourselves new tech stacks not covered in our bootcamp and meeting our set deadline.

## Final Product

Full demo of all React component functions:
